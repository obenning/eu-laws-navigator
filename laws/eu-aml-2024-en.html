Although those rules have existed and evolved over three decades, they are still implemented in a manner not fully consistent with the requirements of an integrated internal market. Therefore, it is necessary that rules on matters currently covered in Directive (EU) 2015/849 which could be directly applicable by the obliged entities concerned are addressed in a Regulation in order to achieve the desired uniformity of application.</p>

Measures adopted at Union level, without taking into account international coordination and cooperation, would have very limited effect. The measures adopted by the Union in that field should therefore be compatible with, and at least as stringent as, actions undertaken at international level. Union action should continue to take particular account of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations and instruments of other international bodies active in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. With a view to reinforcing the efficacy of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the relevant Union legal acts should, where appropriate, be aligned with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the FATF in February 2012 (the ‘revised FATF Recommendations’) and the subsequent amendments to such standards.</p>

For that reason, in line with Directive (EU) 2018/1673, any kind of punishable involvement in the commission of a predicate offence for money laundering as criminalised in accordance with national law should also be considered as a criminal activity for the purposes of that Directive and of this Regulation.</p>

While this is a positive phenomenon, it can generate new money laundering and terrorist financing risks, as criminals continuously manage to find ways to exploit vulnerabilities in order to hide and move illicit funds around the world. Crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding platforms are exposed to the misuse of new channels for the movement of illicit money and are well placed to detect such movement and mitigate risks. The scope of Union legislation should therefore be expanded to cover such entities, in line with FATF standards in relation to crypto-assets. At the same time, advances in innovation, such as the development of the metaverse, provide new avenues for the perpetration of crimes and for the laundering of their proceeds. It is therefore important to exercise vigilance as regards the risks associated with the provision of innovative products or services, whether at Union or national level or at the level of obliged entities.</p>

It extended the scope of the AML/CFT framework to two types of crypto-asset service providers: providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies, and custodian wallet providers. Due to rapid technological developments and the advancement in FATF standards, it is necessary to review that approach. A first step to complete and update the Union legal framework has been achieved with Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc14-L_202401624EN.000101-E0014" href="#ntr14-L_202401624EN.000101-E0014"

It also introduced a definition of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers encompassing a broader range of activities. In addition, Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 has extended traceability requirements to transfers of crypto-assets carried out by crypto-asset service providers covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, and amended Directive (EU) 2015/849 to require Member States to make those crypto-asset service providers obliged entities. Those crypto-asset service providers should also be covered by this Regulation, to mitigate any risk of misuse of crypto-assets for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes.</p>

It is therefore necessary to ensure that all crowdfunding platforms, including those already licensed under Regulation (EU) 2020/1503, are subject to Union AML/CFT legislation.</p>

Such an approach has shown to be ineffective in light of the poor understanding and application of AML/CFT requirements, lack of supervision and limited number of suspicious transactions reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). In order to adequately mitigate risks deriving from the misuse of large cash sums, a Union-wide limit to large cash payments above EUR 10 000 should be laid down.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Motor vehicles, watercraft and aircraft in the higher market segments are vulnerable to risks of misuse for money laundering and terrorist financing given their high value and transportability. Therefore, persons trading in such goods should be subject to AML/CFT requirements. The transportable nature of those goods is particularly attractive for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing given the ease with which such goods can be moved across or outside Union borders, and the fact that access to information on such goods where registered in third countries might not be easily accessible to competent authorities. To mitigate risks that Union high-value goods may be misused for criminal purposes and to ensure visibility on the ownership of such goods, it is necessary to require persons trading in high-value goods to report transactions concerning the sale of motor vehicles, watercraft and aircraft. Credit institutions and financial institutions provide services that are essential for the conclusion of the sale or transfer of ownership of such goods, and should also be required to report those transactions to the FIU. While goods intended solely for the pursuit of commercial activities should not be subject to such disclosure, sales for private, non-commercial use should not be limited to instances where the customer is a natural person, but should also relate to sales to legal entities and arrangements, in particular where they are set up to administer the wealth of their beneficial owner.</p>

Investor residence schemes present risks and vulnerabilities in relation to money laundering, corruption and tax evasion. Such risks are exacerbated by the cross-border rights associated with residence in a Member State. Therefore, it is necessary that investment migration operators are subject to AML/CFT obligations. This Regulation should not apply to investor citizenship schemes, which result in the acquisition of nationality in exchange for such investment, as such schemes must be considered as undermining the fundamental status of Union citizenship and sincere cooperation among Member States.</p>

Depending on their business model, such consumer and mortgage credit intermediaries can be exposed to significant money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It is important to ensure that entities carrying out similar activities that are exposed to such risks are covered by AML/CFT requirements, regardless of whether they qualify as credit institutions or financial institutions. Therefore, it is appropriate to include consumer and mortgage credit intermediaries that are not credit institutions or financial institutions but that are, as a result of their activities, exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing risks. In many cases, however, the credit intermediary is acting on behalf of the credit institution or financial institution that grants and processes the loan. In those cases, AML/CFT requirements should not apply to consumer and mortgage credit intermediaries, but only to the credit institutions or financial institutions.</p>

Although collective investment undertakings already fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849, it is necessary to align the relevant terminology with the current Union investment fund legislation, namely Directives 2009/65/EC <a id="ntc16-L_202401624EN.000101-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_202401624EN.000101-E0016"

Because funds might be constituted without legal personality, the inclusion of their managers in the scope of this Regulation is also necessary. AML/CFT requirements should apply regardless of the form in which units or shares in a fund are made available for purchase in the Union, including where units or shares are directly or indirectly offered to investors established in the Union or placed with such investors at the initiative of the manager or on behalf of the manager. As both funds and fund managers fall within the scope of AML/CFT requirements, it is appropriate to clarify that a duplication of efforts should be avoided. To that end, the AML/CFT measures taken at the level of the fund and at the level of its manager should not be the same, but should reflect the allocation of tasks between the fund and its manager.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The activities of professional football clubs and football agents are exposed to risks of money laundering and its predicate offences due to several factors inherent to the football sector, such as the global popularity of football, the considerable sums, cash flows and financial interests involved, the prevalence of cross-border transactions, and the sometimes opaque ownership structures. All those factors expose football to possible abuse by criminals to legitimise illicit funds and thus make the sport vulnerable to money laundering and its predicate offences. Key areas of risk include, for example, transactions with investors and sponsors, including advertisers, and the transfer of players. Professional football clubs and football agents should therefore put in place robust anti-money laundering measures, including carrying out customer due diligence on investors, sponsors, including advertisers, and other partners and counterparties with whom they transact. In order to avoid any disproportionate burden on smaller clubs that are less exposed to risks of criminal misuse, Member States should be able to, on the basis of a proven lower risk of money laundering, its predicate crimes and terrorist financing, exempt certain professional football clubs from the requirements of this Regulation, whether in full or in part.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The activities of professional football clubs competing in the highest divisions of their national football leagues make them more exposed to higher risks of money laundering and its predicate offences compared to football clubs participating in lower divisions. For example, top-tier football clubs engage in more substantial financial transactions, such as high-value transfers of players and sponsorship deals, might have more complex corporate structures with multiple layers of ownership, and are more likely to engage in cross-border transactions. Those factors make such top-tier clubs more attractive for criminals and provide more opportunities to conceal illicit funds. Therefore, Member States should only be able to exempt professional football clubs participating in the highest division in cases of proven low risk and provided that such clubs have a turnover for each of the previous 2 years of less than EUR 5 000 000 or the equivalent in national currency. Nonetheless, the risk of money laundering is not determined solely by the division in which a football club competes. Lower-division clubs can also be exposed to significant risks of money laundering and its predicate offences. Member States should therefore only be able to exempt from the requirements of this Regulation football clubs in lower divisions that are associated with a proven low risk of money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing.</p>

According to that definition, which requires the actual pursuit of an economic activity at the place of establishment of the provider, a mere letter-box does not constitute an establishment. Equally, offices or other infrastructure used for supporting activities, such as mere back-office operations, IT-hubs or data centres operated by obliged entities, do not constitute an establishment. Conversely, activities such as the provision of crypto-asset services through ATMs constitute an establishment having regard to the limited physical equipment needed for operators that mainly service their customers through the internet, as is the case for crypto-asset service providers.</p>

Those new standards introduced by the FATF do not substitute nor undermine the existing strict requirements for countries to implement targeted financial sanctions to comply with the relevant United Nations Security Council (‘UNSC’) resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing.

Where the law of a third country does not permit compliance with those requirements, for example because of limitations to the group’s ability to access, process or exchange information due to an insufficient level of data protection or banking secrecy law in that third country, obliged entities should take additional measures to ensure that branches and subsidiaries located in that country effectively handle the risks.

Credit institutions and financial institutions play an important role in ensuring that such organisations can continue to conduct their work, by providing access to the financial system and important financial services that allow development and humanitarian funding to be channelled to developing or conflict areas. While obliged entities should be aware that activities conducted in certain jurisdictions expose them to a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, the operation of civil society organisations in those jurisdictions should not, alone, result in the refusal to provide financial services or termination of such services, as the risk-based approach requires a holistic assessment of risks posed by individual business relationships, and the application of adequate measures to mitigate the specific risks. While credit institutions and financial institutions remain free to decide with whom they engage in contractual relationships, they should also be mindful of their central role in the functioning of the international financial system, and in enabling the movement of funds as defined in Article 4, point (25), of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 or of crypto-assets, for the important development and humanitarian goals that civil society organisations pursue. Such institutions should therefore make use of the flexibility allowed by the risk-based approach to mitigate the risks associated with business relationships in a proportionate manner.

Where obliged entities identify discrepancies between information held in the central registers and the information they obtain from the customer or other reliable sources in the course of customer due diligence, they should report those discrepancies to the entity in charge of the relevant central register so that measures can be taken to resolve inconsistencies. That process contributes to the quality and reliability of information held in those registers, as part of a multi-pronged approach towards ensuring that information contained in central registers is accurate, adequate and up-to-date. In low-risk situations and where the beneficial owners are known to the obliged entity, it should be possible for obliged entities to allow the customer to report discrepancies where minor differences are identified that consist of errors of a typographical or similar technical nature.</p>

In order to ensure that the requirements imposed on the sector are commensurate with its risk and do not effectively hamper its operation, it should be possible, in certain proven low-risk circumstances and under strict risk-mitigating conditions, to exempt those products from certain customer due diligence measures, such as the identification and verification of the customer and of the beneficial owner, but not from the monitoring of transactions or of business relationships. It should only be possible for supervisors to grant such an exemption upon verification of the proven low risk having regard to relevant risk factors to be defined by AMLA and in a way that effectively mitigates any risk of money laundering or terrorist financing and that precludes circumvention of AML/CFT rules. In any case, any exemption should be conditional on strict limits regarding the maximum value of the product, its exclusive use to purchase goods or services, and provided that the amount stored cannot be exchanged for other value.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">There are specific situations where, for the purposes of customer due diligence, the customer is not limited to the person transacting with the obliged entity. That is the case, for example, where only one notary is involved in a real estate transaction. In such cases, in order to ensure that adequate checks are carried out on the transaction to detect possible cases of money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing, obliged entities should consider both the buyer and the seller as customers and apply customer due diligence measures on both parties. This Regulation should provide a list of such situations where the customer is not, or is not limited to, the direct customer of the obliged entity. Such a list should complement the understanding of who the customer is in typical situations and should not be understood as encompassing an exhaustive interpretation of the term. Similarly, a business relationship should not always require a contractual relationship or other formal engagement as long as the services are provided repeatedly or over a period of time so as to entail an element of duration. Where national law precludes obliged entities that are public officials from entering into contractual relationships with customers, such national law should not be construed as prohibiting obliged entities from treating a series of transactions as a business relationship for the purposes of AML/CFT.</p>

However, obliged entities that carry out transactions in cash below that limit remain vulnerable to risks of money laundering and terrorist financing as they provide a point of entry into the Union’s financial system. Therefore, it is necessary to require the application of customer due diligence measures to mitigate the risks of misuse of cash. To ensure that the measures are proportionate with the risks posed by transactions of a value lower than EUR 10 000, such measures should be limited to the identification and verification of the customer and the beneficial owner when carrying out occasional transactions in cash of at least EUR 3 000. That limitation does not relieve the obliged entity from applying all customer due diligence measures whenever there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, or from reporting suspicious transactions to the FIU.</p>

In such a business model, the obliged entity’s customer for the purpose of AML/CFT rules is the merchant, and not the merchant’s customer. Therefore, with respect to payment initiation services, customer due diligence measures should be applied by the obliged entity vis-a-vis the merchant.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Gambling activities vary in nature, geographical scope and associated risks. In order to ensure a proportionate and risk-based application of this Regulation, it should be possible for Member States to identify gambling services associated with low money laundering and terrorist financing risks, such as State or private lotteries or State-administered gambling activities, and to decide not to apply all or some of the requirements of this Regulation to them. Given the potential cross-border effects of national exceptions, it is necessary to ensure a consistent application of a strict risk-based approach across the Union. To that end, the Commission should be enabled to approve Member States’ decisions, or to reject them where the exception is not justified by a proven low risk. In any case, no exception should be granted in relation to activities associated with higher risks. This is the case for activities such as casinos, online gambling and sport betting, but is not the case where online gambling activities are administered by the State, whether through direct provision of those services or through regulation of the way in which those gambling services are organised, operated and administered. In light of the risks for public health or of criminal activities that can be associated with gambling, national measures regulating the organisation, operation and administration of gambling, where genuinely pursuing goals of public policy, public security or public health, can contribute to reducing the risks associated with that activity.</p>

To that effect, providers of gambling services should be able to attribute transactions to a given customer even if they have not yet verified the customer’s identity, to be in a position to determine whether and when that threshold has been met. Thus, providers of gambling services should have systems in place that allow attribution and monitoring of transactions prior to the application of the requirement to conduct customer due diligence. In the case of casinos or other physical gambling premises, it can be impractical to check the customer’s identity upon each transaction. In such cases, it should be possible to identify the customer and verify the customer’s identity upon entry into the gambling premises, provided that systems are in place to attribute transactions carried out at the gambling premises, including the purchase or exchange of gambling chips, to that customer.</p>

To ensure the effectiveness of the transaction monitoring, obliged entities’ monitoring activity should in principle cover all services and products offered to customers and all transactions which are carried out on behalf of the customer or offered to the customer by the obliged entity. However, not all transactions need to be scrutinised individually. The intensity of the monitoring should respect the risk-based approach and be designed around precise and relevant criteria, taking account, in particular, of the characteristics of the customer and the risk level associated with them, the products and services offered, and the countries or geographical areas concerned. AMLA should develop guidelines to ensure that the intensity of the monitoring of business relationships and of transactions is adequate and proportionate to the level of risk.</p>

However, there might be situations where the termination should not be pursued due to public interest goals. This is the case, for example, in relation to life insurance contracts, where obliged entities should, where necessary, as an alternative to termination take measures to freeze the business relationship including by prohibiting any further services to that customer and withholding the payout to beneficiaries, until customer due diligence measures can be complied with. Additionally, certain products and services require the obliged entity to continue holding or receiving the customer’s funds as defined in Article 4, point (25), of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, for example in the context of lending, payment accounts or the taking of deposits. That should however not be treated as an impediment to the requirement to terminate the business relationship, which can be achieved by ensuring that no transactions or activities are carried out for the customer.</p>

Where the obliged entity takes a decision to not enter into a business relationship with a prospective customer, or to terminate an existing business relationship, to refuse to carry out an occasional transaction, or to apply alternative measures to terminating a business relationship, the customer due diligence records should include the grounds for such a decision. That will enable supervisory authorities to assess whether obliged entities have appropriately calibrated their customer due diligence practices and how the entity’s risk exposure evolves, as well as help to build statistical evidence on the application of customer due diligence rules by obliged entities throughout the Union.</p>

However, the risk-based approach should not be applied when interacting with a third country’s respondent institutions that have no physical presence where they are created, or with unregistered and unlicensed entities providing crypto-asset services. Given the high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing inherent in shell institutions, credit institutions and financial institutions should refrain from entertaining any correspondent relationship with such shell institutions, as well as with counterparts in third countries that allow their accounts to be used by shell institutions. To avoid misuse of the Union’s financial system to provide unregulated services, crypto-assets service providers should also ensure that their accounts are not used by nested exchanges and should have in place policies and procedures to detect any such attempt.</p>

The persistent nature of those significant strategic deficiencies, reflective of the lack of commitment or continued failure by the third country to tackle them, signal a heightened level of threat emanating from those third countries, which requires an effective, consistent and harmonised mitigating response at Union level. Therefore, obliged entities should be required to apply the whole set of available enhanced due diligence measures to occasional transactions and business relationships involving those high-risk third countries to manage and mitigate the underlying risks. Furthermore, the high level of risk justifies the application of additional specific countermeasures, whether at the level of obliged entities or by the Member States. Such an approach would avoid divergence in the determination of the relevant countermeasures, which would expose the entirety of Union’s financial system to risks. Where Member States identify specific risks that are not mitigated, they should be able to apply additional countermeasures, in which case they should notify the Commission thereof. Where the Commission considers that those risks are of relevance for the internal market, it should be able to update the relevant delegated act to include the necessary additional countermeasures to mitigate those risks. Where the Commission considers that those countermeasures are not necessary and undermine the proper functioning of the Union’s internal market, it should be empowered to decide that the Member State put an end to the specific countermeasure. Prior to triggering the procedure for that decision, the Commission should provide an opportunity to the Member State concerned to submit its views on the consideration of the Commission. Given its technical expertise, AMLA can provide useful input to the Commission in identifying the appropriate countermeasures.</p>

This is likely to represent a risk for the Union’s financial system, and that risk needs to be managed and mitigated. The commitment of those third countries to address identified weaknesses, while not eliminating the risk, justifies a mitigating response less severe than that applicable to high-risk third countries. Where such third countries commit to address identified weaknesses, obliged entities should apply enhanced due diligence measures to occasional transactions and business relationships when dealing with natural persons or legal entities established in those third countries that are tailored to the specific weaknesses identified in each third country. Such granular identification of the enhanced due diligence measures to be applied would, in line with the risk-based approach, also ensure that the measures are proportionate to the level of risk. To ensure such consistent and proportionate approach, the Commission should be able to identify which specific enhanced due diligence measures are required in order to mitigate country-specific risks. Given AMLA’s technical expertise, it can provide useful input to the Commission to identify the appropriate enhanced due diligence measures.</p>

Therefore, it is necessary to include in the category of persons who are or who have been entrusted with prominent public functions the heads of regional and local authorities, including groupings of municipalities and metropolitan regions, with at least 50 000 inhabitants. At the same time, it should be acknowledged that the geography and administrative organisation of Member States vary significantly, and Member States should be able, where appropriate, to set a lower threshold to cover the relevant local authorities on the basis of risk.

Risks can also arise in relation to enterprises of a significant size controlled by regional and local authorities.

Member States are currently required to ensure that corporate and other legal entities, as well as express trusts and other similar legal arrangements, obtain and hold adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on their beneficial ownership. However, the degree of transparency imposed by Member States varies. The rules are subject to divergent interpretations, and that results in different methods to identify beneficial owners of a given legal entity or legal arrangement. This is due, inter alia, to inconsistent methods of calculating indirect ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, and differences between the legal systems of the Member States. This hampers the transparency that was intended to be achieved. It is therefore necessary to clarify the rules to achieve a consistent definition of beneficial owner and its application across the internal market.</p>

In order to support the application of those rules by legal entities, trustees or persons holding an equivalent position in similar legal arrangements and obliged entities, and consistent with the harmonisation goal of this Regulation, it should be possible for the Commission to adopt guidelines setting out how rules to identify the beneficial owners in different scenarios are to be applied, including through the use of case examples.</p>

Ownership interest should encompass both control rights and rights that are significant in terms of receiving a benefit, such as a right to a share of profits or other internal resources or liquidation balance. There might, however, be situations where the risk of certain categories of corporate entities being misused for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes is higher, for example due to the specific higher risk sectors in which those corporate entities operate. In such situations, enhanced transparency measures are necessary to dissuade criminals from setting up or infiltrating those entities, either through direct or indirect ownership or control. In order to ensure that the Union is able to adequately mitigate such varying levels of risk, it is necessary to empower the Commission to identify those categories of corporate entities that should be subject to lower beneficial transparency thresholds. To that end, Member States should inform the Commission where they identify categories of corporate entities that are exposed to higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. In those notifications, it should be possible for Member States to indicate a lower ownership threshold that they consider would mitigate those risks. Such identification should be ongoing and should rely on the results of the risk assessment at Union level and of the national risk assessment as well as on relevant analyses and reports produced by AMLA, Europol or other Union bodies that have a role in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of money laundering and terrorist financing. That lower threshold should be of a sufficiently low level to mitigate the higher risks that corporate entities be misused for criminal purposes. To that end, that lower threshold should in general not be set at more than 15 % of the shares or voting rights or other ownership interest. However, there might be cases in which, on the basis of a risk-sensitive assessment, a higher threshold would be more proportionate to address the identified risks. In those cases, it should be possible for the Commission to set the threshold between 15 % and 25 % of the ownership interest.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">By their complex nature, multi-layered ownership and control structures make the identification of beneficial owners more difficult. The concept of ‘ownership or control structure’ is intended to describe the way in which a legal entity is indirectly owned or controlled, or in which a legal arrangement is indirectly controlled, as a result of the relationships that exist between legal entities or arrangements across multiple layers. In order to ensure a consistent approach throughout the internal market, it is necessary to clarify the rules that apply to those situations. For that purpose, it is necessary to assess simultaneously whether any natural person has a direct or indirect shareholding with 25 % or more of the shares or voting rights or other ownership interest, and whether any natural person controls the direct shareholder with 25 % or more of the shares or voting rights or other ownership interest in the corporate entity. In the case of indirect shareholding, the beneficial owners should be identified by multiplying the shares in the ownership chain. To that end, all shares directly or indirectly owned by the same natural person should be added together. That requires the shareholding on every level of ownership to be taken into account. Where 25 % of the shares or voting rights or other ownership interest in the corporate entity are owned by a shareholder that is a legal entity other than a corporate entity, the beneficial ownership should be determined having regard to the specific structure of the shareholder, including whether any natural person exercises control through other means over a shareholder.</p>

It is therefore necessary to set out clear rules to deal with those situations of multi-layered structure.

Control should be understood as the effective ability to impose one’s will on the corporate entity’s decision-making on substantive issues. The usual means of control is a majority share of voting rights. The position of beneficial owner can also be established by control via other means without having significant, or any, ownership interest. For that reason, in order to ascertain all individuals that are beneficial owners of a legal entity, control should be identified independently of ownership interest. Control can generally be exercised by any means, including legal and non-legal means.

As such, no beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries is determined from the outset, but rather a pool of persons from among which the trustees can choose the beneficiaries, or persons who will become beneficiaries should the trustees not exercise their discretion. As recognised by the recent revision of FATF standards regarding legal arrangements, such discretion can be misused and allow for the obfuscation of beneficial owners if a minimum level of transparency is not imposed for discretionary trusts, as transparency on beneficiaries would only be achieved upon the exercise of the trustees’ discretion. Therefore, in order to ensure an adequate and consistent transparency for all types of legal arrangements, it is important that, in the case of discretionary trusts, information is also collected on the objects of a trustee’s power and on the default takers who would receive the assets or benefits if the trustees fail to exercise their discretion. There are situations where objects of a power or default takers might not be identified individually, but as a class. In those cases, information on the class should be collected, as well as information on the individual persons who are selected from the class.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The characteristics of express trusts and similar legal arrangements in Member States vary. In order to ensure a harmonised approach, it is appropriate to set out common principles for the identification of such arrangements. Express trusts are trusts set up at the initiative of the settlor. Trusts set up by law or that do not result from the explicit intent of the settlor to set them up should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Express trusts are usually set up in the form of a document such as a written deed or written instrument of trust, and usually fulfil a business or personal need. Legal arrangements similar to express trusts are arrangements without legal personality which are similar in structure or functions. The determining factor is not the designation of the type of legal arrangement, but the fulfilment of the basic features of the definition of an express trust, namely the settlor’s intention to place the assets under the administration and control of a certain person for specified purpose, usually of a business or personal nature, such as the benefit of the beneficiaries. To ensure the consistent identification of the beneficial owners of legal arrangements similar to express trusts, Member States should notify to the Commission a list of the types of legal arrangements similar to express trusts. Such notification should be accompanied by an assessment justifying the identification of certain legal arrangements as similar to express trusts as well as explaining why other legal arrangements have been considered to be dissimilar in structure or function from express trusts. In performing such assessment, Member States should take into consideration all legal arrangements that are governed under their law.</p>

Furthermore, there are specific types of legal persons and legal arrangements where beneficiaries exist, but where their identification is not proportionate in respect of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with those legal persons or legal arrangements. That is the case in relation to regulated products such as pension schemes within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc26-L_202401624EN.000101-E0026" href="#ntr26-L_202401624EN.000101-E0026"

Cross-checking of information among those pillars contributes to ensuring that each pillar holds adequate, accurate and up-to-date information. To that end, and in order to avoid discrepancies caused by different approaches, it is important to identify those categories of data that should always be collected in order to ensure the beneficial ownership information is adequate.

Identification of the ownership and control structure allows identification of the ways by which ownership is established or control can be exercised over a legal entity and is therefore essential for a comprehensive understanding of the position of the beneficial owner.

In particular, the record of the actions taken should be promptly provided to competent authorities where required and, on a risk-sensitive basis, it should be possible for that record to include resolutions of the board of directors and minutes of their meetings, partnership agreements, trust deeds, informal arrangements determining powers equivalent to powers of attorney or other contractual agreements and documentation. In cases where the absence of beneficial owners is evident with respect to the specific form and structure of legal entity, the justification should be understood as a reference to that fact, namely that the legal entity does not have a beneficial owner due to its specific form and structure. Such absence of beneficial owners could arise, where, for example, there are no ownership interests in the legal entity or where the legal entity cannot be ultimately controlled by other means.</p>

In that respect, bodies governed by public law of the Member States should not be obliged to determine their beneficial owner.

That is the case where control over the company is exercised through voting rights, and the ownership or control structure of the company only includes natural persons. In those circumstances, there is no need to apply beneficial ownership requirements to those listed companies. The exemption for legal entities from the obligation to determine their own beneficial owner and to register it should not affect the obligation of obliged entities to identify the beneficial owner of a customer when performing customer due diligence.</p>

Those arrangements might obscure the beneficial ownership and control structure if beneficial owners do not wish to disclose their identity or role within them. There is thus a need to introduce transparency requirements in order to avoid such arrangements being misused and to prevent criminals from hiding behind persons acting on their behalf. The relationship between nominee and nominator is not determined by whether it has an effect on the public or third parties. Although nominee shareholders whose names appear in public or official records would formally have independent control over the company, it should be required to disclose whether they are acting on the instructions of someone else on the basis of a private agreement. Nominee shareholders and nominee directors of legal entities should maintain sufficient information on the identity of their nominator as well as of any beneficial owner of the nominator and disclose them as well as their status to the legal entities. The same information should also be reported by legal entities to obliged entities when customer due diligence measures are applied and to the central registers.</p>

Since beneficial ownership standards in place in third countries might not be sufficient to allow for the same level of transparency and timely availability of beneficial ownership information as in the Union, there is a need to ensure adequate means to identify the beneficial owners of foreign legal entities or foreign legal arrangements in specific circumstances. Therefore, legal entities created outside the Union and express trusts or similar legal arrangements administered outside the Union or whose trustees or persons holding an equivalent position reside or are established outside the Union should be required to disclose their beneficial owners where they operate in the Union by entering into a business relationship with a Union’s obliged entity, by acquiring real estate in the Union or certain high value goods from obliged entities located in the Union, or by being awarded a contract following a public procurement procedure for goods or services, or concessions. There might be variations in the risk exposure across Member States, including depending on the category or type of activities carried out by obliged entities and on the attractiveness for criminals of real estate properties in their territory. Therefore, where Member States identify cases of higher risk, they should be able to take additional mitigating measures to address those risks.</p>

The private nature of legal arrangements, and the obstacles in accessing beneficial ownership information in the case of foreign legal arrangements, justify the application of a registration requirement irrespective of the level of risk associated with the obliged entity providing services to the legal arrangement, or, where relevant, with the sector in which the legal arrangement operates.

Given the evolving risk environment, that guidance should be reviewed regularly, and should not prejudge the issuance by FIUs of guidance or indicators on money laundering and terrorist financing risks and methods identified at national level. The disclosure of information to the FIU in good faith by an obliged entity or by an employee or director of such an entity should not constitute a breach of any restriction on disclosure of information and should not involve the obliged entity or its directors or employees in liability of any kind.</p>

In those cases, the predicate offence need not be specified by the obliged entity when reporting a suspicious transaction to the FIU, if it is not known to them. Where that information is available, it should be included in the report. As gatekeepers of the Union’s financial system, obliged entities should also be able to submit a report where they know or suspect that funds have been or will be used to carry out criminal activities, such as the purchase of illicit goods, even if the information available to them does not indicate that the funds used originate from illicit sources.</p>

Their unfettered and swift access to information is essential to ensure that flows of money can be properly traced and illicit networks and flows detected at an early stage. The need for FIUs to obtain additional information from obliged entities based on a suspicion of money laundering or financing of terrorism might be triggered by a prior suspicious transaction report reported to the FIU, but might also be triggered through other means such as the FIU’s own analysis, intelligence provided by competent authorities or information held by another FIU. FIUs should therefore be able, in the context of their functions, to obtain information from any obliged entity, even without a prior report being made. In particular, records of financial transactions and transfers carried out through a bank, payment or crypto-asset account are critical for the analytical work of FIUs. However, due to the lack of harmonisation, at present credit institutions and financial institutions provide FIUs with transaction records in different formats, which are not readily useable for analysis. Considering the cross-border nature of FIUs’ analytical activities, the disparity of formats and difficulties of processing transaction records hamper the exchange of information among FIUs and the development of cross-border financial analyses. AMLA should therefore develop draft implementing technical standards specifying a common template for the provision of transaction records by credit institutions and financial institutions to FIUs to be used as a uniform basis throughout the Union.</p>

Those deadlines should apply to information requests that are based on sufficiently defined conditions. An FIU should also be able to obtain information from obliged entities upon request made by another FIU and to exchange the information with the requesting FIU. Requests to obliged entities vary in nature. For example, complex requests might necessitate more time and warrant an extended deadline for response.

Information sharing should be subject to robust safeguards relating to confidentiality, data protection, use of information and criminal procedure. Obliged entities should not rely solely on information received through the exchange of information to draw conclusions on the money laundering and terrorist financing risk of the customer or transaction or to take decisions regarding the establishment or termination of a business relationship or the carrying out of a transaction.

Information that indicates suspicious activity is subject to stricter rules that prohibit its disclosure and should only be shared where necessary for the purposes of preventing and combating money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing and subject to safeguards protecting fundamental rights, the confidentiality of FIU work and the integrity of law enforcement investigations.</p>

Obliged entities should pay particular attention to the principles requiring that the personal data processed in the course of compliance with their AML/CFT obligations be accurate, reliable and up-to-date. For the purposes of complying with this Regulation, obliged entities should be able to adopt processes that enable automated individual decision-making, including profiling, as set out under Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The collection and subsequent processing of personal data by obliged entities should be limited to what is necessary for the purpose of complying with AML/CFT requirements and personal data should not be further processed in a way that is incompatible with that purpose.

At the same time, differences in approaches among Member States have undermined the level playing field within the internal market to the detriment of businesses located in Member States with stricter controls. It is therefore necessary to introduce a Union-wide limit to large cash payments of EUR 10 000. Member States should be able to adopt lower thresholds and further stricter provisions to the extent that they pursue legitimate objectives in the public interest. Given that the AML/CFT framework is based on the regulation of the business economy, the limit should not apply to payments between natural persons who are not acting in a professional capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that the Union-wide limit does not unintentionally create barriers for persons who do not use or do not have access to banking services to make payments, or for business to deposit the income from their activities in their accounts, payments or deposits made at the premises of credit institutions, payment institutions or electronic money institutions should also be exempted from the application of the limit.</p>

The reporting of such transactions enables the FIU to assess and identify patterns concerning the movement of cash and, while such information contributes to the FIU’s operational or strategic analyses, the nature of threshold-based disclosures makes them distinct from suspicious transaction reports. To that effect, threshold-based disclosures do not replace the requirement to report suspicious transactions or to apply enhanced due diligence measures in cases of higher risk. It should be possible for FIUs to require the reports to be made within a specific deadline, which could include the periodic submission on an aggregated basis.</p>

In such cases, Member States should be able to suspend the application of the limit on large cash payments. Such a suspension is an extraordinary measure and should only be applied where necessary as a response to exceptional, duly justified, situations. An impossibility to access financial services does not constitute a valid ground for the suspension of the limit where it is attributable to a Member State’s failure to guarantee that consumers have access to financial infrastructure across the entirety of its territory.</p>

Finally, given the risks associated with high-value goods in free trade zones, the Commission should assess the need to expand the scope of information to be reported by operators trading and storing high-value goods in such free trade zones.</p>
